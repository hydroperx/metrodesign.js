- [ ] `.detect()`
  - [ ] Contributes a newly-added DOM tile, or detects moving X/Y, resizing and group transfer (look at parent).
    - [ ] If the tile was previously detected for a different layout limit/direction, then disregard whether X/Y has changed or not.
  - [ ] Or contributes a newly-added DOM group, or detects label change.
- [ ] `.removeTile()`
