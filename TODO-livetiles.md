- A class `Tiles`
  - That supports a `bool MoveTile(string id, int x, int y)` method.
    - Save a snapshot of the tiles.
    - Move tile `id` to the specified (x, y) position.
    - Call `fit(tile)`
    - If `resolveConflicts(id)` is true
      - Call `fillMinimumPosition();`
      - Call `compact();`
      - Return `true`.
    - Otherwise, restore snapshot of the tiles.
    - Return `false`.
  - That supports a `bool ResizeTile(string id, int width, int height)` method.
    - If tile to resize is out of bounds, return `false`.
    - Save a snapshot of the tiles.
    - Resize tile `id` to the specified size.
    - If `resolveConflicts(id)` is true, return `true`.
    - Otherwise, restore snapshot of the tiles.
    - Return `false`.
  - That supports a `void RemoveTile(string id)` method.
    - Neighbour tiles that are below (i.e. `neighbour.Y > removed.Y && neighbour.X >= removed.X && neighbour.X + neighbour.Width <= removed.X + removed.Width`) are pushed towards the removed tile's position.
    - Call `fillMinimumPosition();`
    - Call `compact();`
  - That implements an internal method `void compact()` for removing holes between tiles.
    - If there are holes between tiles, snap tile clusters such that there are no holes anymore (e.g. undo horizontal holes by snapping clusters from right to left; undo vertical holes by snapping clusters from the bottom to the top).
  - That implements an internal method `void fillMinimumPosition()`.
    - If there are any tiles and the position (0, 0) is not occupied, snap tile clusters such that the position (0, 0) is occupied.
  - That provides an utility method for determining whether a rectangle fully enters a tile. Useful for implementing folders.
    - Folder implementation would be like "drag tile over another": if it hadn't began 'merging into a folder', then begin and stay so for 1.5 secs; if already, then move tile instead.
